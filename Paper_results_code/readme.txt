includes the MATLAB files for generating the results presented in the paper. In order to generate the figures, the following folders (downloaded as .zip) have to be included in this folder (Paper_results_code) 

. Data_results_fig1: folder containing the data and the simulation results for Fig 1 to be included in /Paper_results_code (https://mega.nz/folder/b1pkzLiI#K719OS1_sWqZ7Pa9cHlNtQ)

. Data_results_fig2: folder containing the data and the simulation results for Fig 2 to be included in /Paper_results_code (https://mega.nz/folder/rthAmTBS#hHrPIL44t_FvM_wl0nUucQ)

. Data_results_figs_3_4_S1: folder containing the data and the simulation results for Figs 3, 4 and S1 to be included in /Paper_results_code (https://mega.nz/folder/6gh0AZIK#1KxDyg8hcEQxocMNAj6qNw)

. Bio_Example_data_results: folder containing the data and the simulation results for Figs 5 and 6 to be included in /Paper_results_code (https://mega.nz/folder/DowwXDCS#n9vexHt3RQJUWoRJhKWItw)

. MainFigure1.m: script for generating the results shown in Fig 1 obtained by RIVA and compared with those yielded by dynGenie3 and Bingo. 

. MainFigure2.m: script for generating the results shown in Fig 2 obtained by RIVA and compared with those yielded by dynGenie3. 

. MainFigure2all.m: script for generating the results obtained by RIVA and the other LS-based approaches on the in silico E. coli network of 1565 nodes for each replica (overall 20 replicas) of the original experimental batch. The RIVA results shown in Fig 2 are obtained by taking into account the inference results on this 20 replicated batches. 

. MainFigure3.m: script for generating the results shown in Fig 3 obtained by RIVA and compared with those yielded by dynGenie3 and Bingo.

. MainFigure4.m: script for generating the results shown in Fig 4 obtained by RIVA and compared with those yielded by dynGenie3 and Bingo. 

. MainFigureS1aeimq.m: script for generating the results shown in the first column of Fig S1 (panels a, e, i, m and q) obtained by RIVA and compared with those yielded by the other LS-based approaches.

. MainFigureS1bfjnr.m: script for generating the results shown in the second column of Fig S1 (panels b, f, j, n and r) obtained by RIVA and compared with those yielded by the other LS-based approaches.

. MainFigureS1cgkos.m: script for generating the results shown in the third column of Fig S1 (panels c, g, k, o and s) obtained by RIVA and compared with those yielded by the other LS-based approaches.

. MainFigureS1dhlpt.m: script for generating the results shown in the fourth column of Fig S1 (panels d, h, l, p and t) obtained by RIVA and compared with those yielded by the other LS-based approaches.

. MainFigures5and6_abc.m: script for generating the results shown in the first row of Figs 5 and 6 (panels a, b and c), corresponding to the results obtained by using the experimental data-set E-MTAB-643, with a given sample time ts (within the script, set the parameter val_ts= 15, 10 or 8).  

. MainFigures5and6_def.m: script for generating the results shown in the second row of Figs 5 and 6 (panels d, e and f), corresponding to the results obtained by using the experimental data-set E-MTAB-1908, with a given sample time ts (within the script, set the parameter val_ts= 15, 10 or 8).

. MainFigures5and6_ghi.m: script for generating the results shown in the third row of Figs 5 and 6 (panels g, h and i), corresponding to the results obtained by using both the experimental data-sets, E-MTAB-[643:1908], with a given sample time ts (within the script, set the parameter val_ts= 15, 10 or 8).
