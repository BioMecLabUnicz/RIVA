./experimental_microarray_data

includes the MATLAB files for generating the results presented in the paper, for Figs. 5 and 6.

. Bio_Example_data_results: folder containing the data and the simulation results for Figs. 5 and 6 to be included in /experimental_microarray_data.

. Main_riva_s_cerevisiae_e643_diff_ts.m: script for generating the results shown in the first row of Figs. 5 and 6, corresponding to the results obtained by using the experimental data-set E-MTAB-643, with a given sample time ts (within the script, set the parameter val_ts= 15, 10 or 8).  

. Main_riva_s_cerevisiae_e1908_diff_ts.m: script for generating the results shown in the second row of Figs. 5 and 6, corresponding to the results obtained by using the experimental data-set E-MTAB-1908, with a given sample time ts (within the script, set the parameter val_ts= 15, 10 or 8).

. Main_riva_s_cerevisiae_e643_1908_diff_ts.m: script for generating the results shown in the third row of Figs. 5 and 6, corresponding to the results obtained by using both the experimental data-sets, E-MTAB-[643:1908], with a given sample time ts (within the script, set the parameter val_ts= 15, 10 or 8).
