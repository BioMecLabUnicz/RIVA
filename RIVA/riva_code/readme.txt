./riva_code
includes the MATLAB files for running RIVA

In particular,


. net_rec_ls_full_iv.m, allowing to identify the reconstructed connectivity matrix A and the perturbation matrix B from multi-time-series data, using time-series with the same number of samples.
The inputs are: 
1. Meas_mtx, measurements matrix, each column contains the measurements for a node.

2. B_mtx, a list that contains the information about the b-coefficients, it is empty for default.
               
3. Constr_mtx, a matrix with 3 columns, for the constraints to be imposed on the matrix coefficients, it is empty for default.
  
4. num_exp, a scalar for the number of multi-time-series.

5. DREAM4, a flag that is false for default.

The outputs are:
1. A_id_cell, a cell array containing the identified connectivity matrices A for the different LS methods, at {1,1} for LS, at {1,2} for RLS, at {1,3} for RIVA (RLS-IV).
               
2. B_id_cell, a cell array containing the identified input matrices B for the LS methods, at {1,1} for LS, at {1,2} for RLS, at {1,3} for RIVA.
                  
3. est_err_cell, a cell array containing the estimation error generated by the identified models, at {1,1} for LS, at {1,2} for RLS, at {1,3} for RIVA.
  
4. sol_found_cell, a cell array containing a flag (true, if a solution has been found) for the different methods, at {1,1} for LS, at {1,2} for RLS, at {1,3} for RIVA.
