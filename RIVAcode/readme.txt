./RIVAcode
includes the MATLAB files for running RIVA and the other LS-based approaches (LS, LS-IV and RLS)

In particular,

. net_rec_riva.m allowing to identify the reconstructed connectivity matrix A and the perturbation matrix B obtained by RLS and RIVA from multi-time-series data; the function allows imposing the desired zero entries of the connectivity matrix A and of the input matrix B. If no information is available on A and B, then the input variables B_mtx  and Constr_mtx are empty (see below).

	The INPUT VARIABLES are

	Meas_mtx: Measurements matrix, each column contains the measurements for a node

	B_mtx: Matrix that contains the information about the b-coefficients to be nullified
                
	Constr_mtx: Matrix with 3 columns.
            Constraints to be imposed on the matrix A coefficients; 
            first column --> row-index of the constrained coefficient;
            second column --> column-index of the constrained coefficient;
            third column --> type of constraint:
                                   0 --> null coefficient constraint
	num_tps_4exp: a vector containing the number of time points for each experiment (time-series), num_tps_4exp(i)= number of time points for the i-th time-series. The number of rows of Meas_mtx is equal to sum(num_tps_4exp).

	The OUTPUT VARIABLES are:

	A_id_cell: cell array containing the identified connectivity matrices, for RLS (A_id_cell{1,1}) and RIVA (A_id_cell{1,2}) 
               
	B_id_cell: the identified input matrices for RLS (B_id_cell{1,1}) and  RIVA (B_id_cell{1,2})
                 
	est_err_cell:   cell array containing the estimation error generated by the identified models (RLS, est_err_cell{1,1}; RIVA, est_err_cell{1,2}) 

	sol_found_cell: cell array containing a flag (1 or 0) on the stability of the identified system, determining the mode for obtaining the simulated data matrix (see riva.m
function); sol_found_cell{1,1} for RLS, sol_found_cell{1,2} for RIVA 



. net_rec_ls_iv.m: allowing to identify the reconstructed connectivity matrix A and the perturbation matrix B obtained by LS and LS-IV from multi-time-series data; the function allows imposing the desired zero entries of the connectivity matrix A and of the input matrix B. If no information is available on A and B, then the input variables B_mtx  and Constr_mtx are empty (see below).

	The  INPUT VARIABLES are the same of net_rec_riva.m

	The OUTPUT VARIABLES are:

	A_id_cell: cell array containing the identified connectivity matrices, for LS (A_id_cell{1,1}) and LS-IV (A_id_cell{1,2}) 
	               
	B_id_cell: the identified input matrices for LS (B_id_cell{1,1}) and  LS-IV (B_id_cell{1,2})
                 
	est_err_cell: cell array containing the estimation error generated by the identified models (LS, est_err_cell{1,1}; LS-IV, est_err_cell{1,2}) 

	sol_found_cell: cell array containing a flag (1 or 0) on the stability of the identified system, determining the mode for obtaining the simulated data matrix (see ls_iv.m
function); sol_found_cell{1,1} for LS, sol_found_cell{1,2} for LS-IV
